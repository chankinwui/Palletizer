# Palletizer

## Introduction
This is a simple yet effective, and interesting program  to solve pallatizing problem. Specifically, the Manufactuere Pallet Loading (MPL) problem, which is beleived to be a NP-complete problem. There are many papers and mathematical models to describe and solve it. In this program, I use the chess method (traditional approach like Deep Blue, NOT the one in AlphaGo Zero).

## Chess
The idea of chess programming is very simple, but of course there are many genius skills. Here is a simplified logic:
